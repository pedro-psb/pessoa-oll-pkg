# Definitions
This modules contain:
- **Definitions** of note-names, drum-styles and glyphs.
	They should have a clear API, so the importer knows what names
	will be avaliable and where they can be used. 
- **Presets** bundling the include of a set of definitions.
	If one chooses the "manden preset I", the module loads
	the corresponding drumDef and NoteNames. "manden preset II"
	could load some different drumDefs or NoteNames. It should also load
	some special glyphs, like the muffling noteHead.
