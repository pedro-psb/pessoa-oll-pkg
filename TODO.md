# WIP
- finish testing "toolbox"
    This module should handle **presets/toolsets**:
    If one chooses the "manden preset I", the module loads
    the corresponding drumDef and NoteNames. "manden preset II"
    could load some different drumDefs or NoteNames. It should also load
    some special glyphs, like the muffling noteHead.

# TODO
- define "toolsets" functionality inside "toolbox"
- use the "toolbox" in the local "lalily-templates"
- change Frescobaldi color scheme.
- finish the lalily-exercises and lalily-manden.

# DONE
