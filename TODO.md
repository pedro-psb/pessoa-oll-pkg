# Pessoa Package TODO
## WIP
- [] finish developing "toolbox"
	> This module should handle **presets**:
	If one chooses the "manden preset I", the module loads
	the corresponding \drum-mods wich contains "drum-style" and "note-names".
	"manden preset II" could load some different "drum-style"/"note-names"
	It should also load some special glyphs, like the muffling noteHead.
	
	[] setting up drum-style and note-name as tools. (test loadTools)
	[] setting up presets.ily

## TODO
- [] implement manden workflow using toolbox.presets (no lalily dependency)
- [] implement manden workflow with lalily-templates (which internaly uses toolbox)
- [] implement exercises-book

## DONE
