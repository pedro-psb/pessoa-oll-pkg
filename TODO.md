# Pessoa Package TODO
## WIP
- [] finish developing "toolbox" alpha
	> This module should handle **presets/toolsets**:
	If one chooses the "manden preset I", the module loads
	the corresponding drumDef and NoteNames. "manden preset II"
	could load some different drumDefs or NoteNames. It should also load
	some special glyphs, like the muffling noteHead.
	
	[] setting up drum-style and note-name as tools. (test loadTools)
	[] setting up presets.ily

## TODO

- [] implement exercises-book
